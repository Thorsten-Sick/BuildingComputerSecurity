# Basics: Know your attackers

Attackers come in several flavours and can even be enemies or friends.

Just because someone found a vulnerability in your application he is not
necessarily an enemy. What he does with this knowledge - help or harm you -
will define the attacker.

You will know maybe feel a reflex like "No one will hack my hardware/software".
This is a protective reflex which will do you more harm than good. Relax,
be open minded and enjoy the taxonomy of hackers.

## Hackers

The good Hackers will notify you as soon as they found a vulnerability in your code.
Get into touch and they will help you to close it. Be aware: You will get a
very expensive service (pen testing) for free!

Goal: Curiosity. And fame. And creating a more secure world

Target: Does not have to be a high value target. Crazy things work even better

Resources: They will invest hundreds of engineering hours

Responsible Disclosure: You can expect them to behave responsibly

Do: Respond friendly to their mail, they are partners

Don't: Respond with a lawsuite. This will harm you on the long run. You will never ever get a responsible disclosure anymore.


An example:

[Natalie Silvanovich](#reference-tamagotchi): Who presented the hacking of Tamagotchis at a hacker conference. Twice.

## University researchers

Similar to hackers. They have more resources. But their goal is more academic:
They do not necessarily want to produce a working exploit as long as the idea and
approach are totally new.


Do: Enjoy their ideas

Don't: Be distracted. Most attacks used at the moment are several years old.

## Script kiddies

Goal: Invoke mayhem, show off

Target: They know a few tricks, have some tools and choose their target by what they can hack

Resources: Some tools

Do: Protect agains standard attacks

## Organized Crime

Those are the powers currently creating malware and are making lots of money.
It is organised crime because they have spcialists for all those tasks needed to:

* Build malware
* Spread it
* Control it (bot herders)
* Cash in (money mules)

Their major goal is to make money. As there are lots of ways to do that it is
hard to predict what the next way will be. We currently have:

* Stealing accounts
* Using bandwidth for DDOS
* Blackmail shops with DDOS attacks
* Stealing private data and credentials (mail addresses for SPAM, credit card numbers, ....)
* Ransomware
* Cryptominer to use the victims power and CPU to mine crypto currencies

Modern malware is modular and can be deployed with several of these attack modules.

The Command and Control interfaces of the malware are shipped with statistics dashboard where
attackers can decide what kind of module will currently have the best ROI.
