# Frida {#chapter-frida}

%% TODO: Add this to the book !

A kind of manual Cuckoo monitor:

Python code injects a JavaScript VM into a process. As soon as it is running there, JavaScript code can manipulate the executing processes.

[Frida.re](https://frida.re)

## Installation and setup

{lang="bash"}
    pip install frida  # library
    pip install frida-tools  # command line tools
    sudo sysctl kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0  # ptrace can be used by processes with the same uid

I saw target program crashes with several frida settings. Maybe you will not want to test it on your live system...

## frida-discover

{lang="bash"}
    frida-discover -p <pid>

Returns a list of called functions, including call count and the shared object they are in.

Good first assessment, but frida-trace with wildcard is more detailed.

## frida-trace

Blasphemy and madness (takes lots of time)

{lang="bash"}
    frida-trace -p <pid> -i "*"

Will hook into every library function and start tracing.

Better filter it (used that for *ping*):

{lang="bash"}
    frida-trace -p <pid> -i "*sendto*"
    # 824 ms sendto(sockfd=0x3, buf=0x..., len=0x40, flags=0x0, dest_addr=0x..., addrlen=0x10)
