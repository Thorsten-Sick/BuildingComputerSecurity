# Intro {#chapter-offense-intro}

I have been struggling if to add this chapter. I totally despise scare tactics.
IMHO they are unethical and they can backfire. People get to scared to act.

But as a normal engineer you normally do not have the perspective and the tools of the attacker. And as long as you do not have at least a bit of
understanding for the atackers capabilities you assume your technology is secure - while it is not.

For that reason I add the *Offense* part to the book.
But:

* It is at the end of the book - after all the defense tricks you can use to defend your systems
* I will point you to at least a few introduced technologies ot protect yourself. There are more. Some are even in this book
* Most of the tools in here can be used to test you systems
* I will not go into depth but focus on introducing concepts and risks
* There will be sources for *further reading* linked
