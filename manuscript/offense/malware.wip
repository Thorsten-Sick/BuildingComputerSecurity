# Malware

Do not write malware. Especially not autonomous ones.

There are several reasons. I have seen lots of
"good intented" lab malware escaping. With a hell
of collateral damage and shattered existences.

Do not patch malware. Yes, by adding some bytes to an
existing malware file you can break stupid
hash-based detection. But you do not know the
malware and it's attack features. Could go horribly wrong.
And you kind of proofed nothing.

But there is a case foor writing **malware simulators**

## First: Test your connections

First you test if your detection technology is connected properly to all
incoming data channels. For that you can be quite creativ.

* Mail the eicar test file
* Zip it first
* Download it using a browser
* ...

Do the same with the test urls (see browser chapter)
