# Google Dork {#chapter-google-dork}

## Basics

Google Dorks are a simple and passive way to enumerate vulnerable systems on the internet. All web pages and web apps are a potential target.

By using advanced google searches the attacker searches for indicator for known vulnerabilities.

This can be a specific part of the URL path using the google *inurl* search.

## Vulnerability indicators

Many web sites use existing web frameworks and applications (blogs, forums, shops) and only change configuration and style. Which is fine.
No one has to re-invent the wheel. But this software is complex. Complex software contains bugs. And if it not patched after a vulnerability gets
published the service or one of the plugins can be attacked.

Finding these vulnerable sites is much easier with an exploit database like [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/).

## Defense

This technology will help the attacker assess potential vulnerabilities (SQL injection, old software).
A good defense is to keep your frameworks, web apps and plugins up to date. Maybe sometimes use Google dorks yourself on your own pages to identify vulnerabilities.
