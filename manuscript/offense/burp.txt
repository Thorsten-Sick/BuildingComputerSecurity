## Defense

* Use a check list like [OWASP top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) to review your page
* Hire a pen tester to test your web sites
    * Burp is expensive and needs experience to interpret results
* Have a pen tester in the team (large projects)
* Basically: Apply best practice in design and development when writing your web page
