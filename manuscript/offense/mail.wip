# Mail hacking

Finding open relays:

{lang="bash"}
    telnet <ip> 25

    helo test
    mail from: lala@test.de
    rcpt to: own_address@mail.de
    data
    Subject: This is a test
    From: faked@something.de

    Mail text
    .

    quit

If doing this on an open relay it will send a mail to the own address.
Open relays are what spammers are looking for.
