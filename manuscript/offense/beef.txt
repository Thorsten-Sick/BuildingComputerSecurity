# Beef {#chapter-beef}

## Basics

[Beef](https://beefproject.com/) is a browser exploitation toolkit. It is meant to attack browsers in various ways by inserting a small one-line
hook into "harmless" homepages.

That can be done by setting up these pages, infecting existing ones or doing a MITM attack onto a web connection.

Many of these attacks are also integrated into Exploit Kits and spread typical malware or help phishing.

Beef is relevant for you if you:

* Produce application with a web interface for configuration
* Run a network where users browser the web in
* Build a browser or similar (webview)

## Features

Beef has a web interface and will list all hooked browsers. As soon as a browser is hooked you can attack it in many different ways.

* Display Facebook login page popup (phishing)
* Scan the local network of the browser (ping, ports)
* Attack routers/access points from the hooked browser
* Tunnel connections through the hooked browser
* Fingerprint the browser

Beef is a tool for targeted attacks. But opportunistic attacks by infected web sites to browsers ("drive-by") use similar exploits and technologies.

And this is the common thing your users will experience.

## Defense

* Encrypt the connection, use HSTS
* Educate users
* Firewall network traffic
* Keep your browser up to date
* Test with beef
