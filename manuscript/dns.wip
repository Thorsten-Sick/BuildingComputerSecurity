## DNSSEC

DNSSEC signs DNS answers and protects from DNS spoofing and DNS cache poisoning. The requests and answers are *not* encrypted and do not provide confidentiality.

[DNSSEC](https://dnssec.net/)

## DNS classic

The standard DNS. DNS request are sent to the UDP port 53. For larger DNS requests there must be a fallback to TCP, same port.

## DNS over HTTPS (DoH)

HTTPS as transport for DNS. Port 443. Connection is to a web server which forwards it to DNS. This will kill network based DNS security filter technology. Which is a mixed blessing.

IMHO: Filtering must happen at the end-point

Another issue with DoH can be company internal pages. An external 3rd party DoH server will not direct the browser to them.

Current state (middle of 2019):

Browser vendors are pushing for DoH. An RFC is available. Experiments in browsers are running.

DoH looks like web traffic. It can not be blocked. This is better than what DoT offers - which can be identified. That is the reason why DoH is more private than DoT.

[RFC 8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484)

## DNS over TLS (DoT)

TLS as transport for DNS. The DNS packets are standard DNS packets. The port being used is 853 TCP.

## DNS over QUIC (DoQ)

QUIC as transport for DNS (Google protocol)

## DNS over Cloud (DoC)

DNS via cloud services (Q9, Cloudflare, ...)

## DNS name generation

You will also want to use a performant DNS resolver:

%% Sec list has a DNS list for sub domain brute forcing: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists

%% TODO: Subdomain Takeover research.
%% Short and wrong:
%% A Domain has sub-domains. Those are running on a different hoster.
%% Original domain now has a CNAME that re-directs to the DNS of the 2nd hoster
%% Everything looks like it is on one system.
%% Discontinuing the services on the 2nd hoster but keeping the CNAME intact allows
%% Anyone on the 2nd hoster to take the subdomain and host the own stuff.
%% Can result in cookie theft (depends on cookie config) and impersonating.
