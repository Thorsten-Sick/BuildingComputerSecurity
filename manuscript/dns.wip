%% TODO: tool dnsrecon seems cool

%% TODO: Subdomain Takeover research.
%% Short and wrong:
%% A Domain has sub-domains. Those are running on a different hoster.
%% Original domain now has a CNAME that re-directs to the DNS of the 2nd hoster
%% Everything looks like it is on one system.
%% Discontinuing the services on the 2nd hoster but keeping the CNAME intact allows
%% Anyone on the 2nd hoster to take the subdomain and host the own stuff.
%% Can result in cookie theft (depends on cookie config) and impersonating.
