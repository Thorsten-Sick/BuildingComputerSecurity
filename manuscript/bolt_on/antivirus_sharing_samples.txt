# Sharing malware samples {#chapter-sharing-samples}

This chapter is about contacting AV vendors and sending them malware you found.
Also about fixing false positives with the help of those vendors.

Some software companies seem to have bad karma and the software they release has a high likely hood of being flagged as malware  - despite being harmless.
This can be caused by uncommon build tools and post-build processing of the software. For those unlucky software teams: Get into close contact with the
AV companies and fix this problem together. More about that in this chapter.

**AV companies hate causing false positives**

By reporting found FPs you help yourself and them.

They are also interested in the newest malware. Are you running a server that turned out to be a malware magnet ? Contact your AV vendor.

The basic data the vendors need is the files. But they will also love to have some background information. Maybe they already have the sample in their large database. But it did not get a proper name or the proper priority because it
was just "one in a million". The detection name will just be a number or "Agent-something-number" kind of name.

But if you are an NGO or run essential government infrastructure, that could increase the priority of the malware a lot - tell the AV vendor that!

In addition to the file, there is more information that will help the virus labs to process the data.

You do not have to submit all those info, the list is more an inspiration.

**Storing first**

If you have a suspicious file you want to share you should store it properly on your computer first.

Some things to know:
* Stored files are no problem. Executed are
* Your AV will have a so called *Quarantine*. This is an encrypted file storing the found malware
    * One of the less known reasons it encrypts the found malware: That way it will not be detected a second time by another scanner and cause confusion
* Most malware is multi-staged. Several files, URLs and registry entries are involved. Gotta catch them all
* There is file-less malware that only exists in memory or registry keys. It is hard to extract that from your system
* Rename your malware files from .exe to .vir. It is a tradition that protects you from accidentally starting it.
    * Better use a zip file with the password *infected*
    * One step better (to avoid accidents) is to use a crypto container like [veracrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/code/VeraCrypt/)
    * An old alternative to Veracrypt is Truecrypt. Not availanble anymore. But maybe you can remember it.

**Info for malware**

* Are you a NGO or special target ?
* How did you get the malware ? (Infection chain)
    * Mail
    * Mail sending you to a URL
    * Other social media
* Did it do anything to your system ?
* Any URLs connected to this malware - do your server logs show any traffic caused by the sample ?
* Any registry keys or mutexes created by the sample ?

**Info for false positives**

* Did you write this software yourself ?
* Did you have FPs before on your software ?
* Where did you get this software ?

**IOC**

No matter if reporting false positives or malware, having the IOCs (Indicators Of Compromise)
in your report will help the AV labs to scan their database for info:

* The file
* A hash of your file (md5, sha1) - which one to use depends on the database of the AV vendor
* URLs

## The reason why your software is detected as a false positive (all the time)

In the AV company's virus lab unknown software is classified. Basically into the categories "cleanstuff" (harmless) and "malware".

There are lots of classifiers in virus labs. And normally unknown software will have to face all of them.

**Analysis sandboxes**: Virtual Machines that observe the software running and modifying the system.

**Structural analysis**: Checks if it is compiled using an exotic compiler, modified from assembler, ...

**Reputation based** could analyse how your software is globally distributed. A low
install base and something "sneaky" could be an indicator for a targeted malware.

**Automatic debuggers**: Stepping through your software and trying to find strange behaviour.

**Artificial Intelligence**: Grouping similar samples. And checking if the new
sample is closer to a "cleanstuff" or the "malware" group.

**Humans**: Analysing unknown software that is in the dark grey area.

Normally a virus lab can get about 4 new malware samples per second. And even more clean or broken files in addition. Automatic classification is king.

If you contact the virus lab they could give you a hint what triggered their machines. And how to avoid it.

## Where to submit to AV companies

I just googled "avast submit sample" and got directly sent to their page for
submission: [Avast submission page](https://www.avast.com/report-malicious-file.php). You should submit to the AV you are using and maybe to 3 more (for good measure).

I'll just drop some names here and you can start searching yourself:

Avast, Kaspersky, Eset, Avira, Microsoft Windows Defender, F-Secure, Bitdefender

## Submission by Mail

Sometimes AV people send mails with attached malware around (from support people to the lab, for example). The tradition is:
The malware sample is zipped. And password protected. The password is "infected".
This is to prevent anyone from accidentally double click the wrong file.

No, it is not top-secure. This is not the goal. It is to prevent accidents.

When dealing the whole day with malware you learn one thing: Double clicks happen. Do not ask for detail. Renaming a *.exe into a *.vir protects you.

## Security without borders

One of the NGOs handling potential cyber attacks on endangered people is [Security Without Borders](https://www.securitywithoutborders.org/)

If you are in special danger contact them as well.

## Citizen Lab

Also relevant for high profile attacks on NGOs is the Citizen Lab. They did some interesting and relevant research the last few years.

[Citizenlab](https://citizenlab.ca/)

If you are in special danger contact them as well.

## CCC

The German hackers - organized in the CCC club - already got some fame for finding and analysing the German Government-Trojan. If you have a sample of a
malware that is state sponsored it may be worth the effort to contact them.

[CCC](https://www.ccc.de/)

## Sucker punch

The AV companies are on the side of their customers and fight online crime. With the Kaspersky accusations and more and more state sponsored malware, trust in the AV companies is eroding. IMHO the big AV companies practice fair play -
including Kaspersky. But I can understand that non-insiders do not trust them.

If you should not trust the AV guys (because your malware is for example Russian state malware and you do not trust Kaspersky), you could do the following:

* Send the malware to all AV vendors with details why you think it is state sponsored
* Also send the same samples and description to the big testers
    * [AV-Test](https://www.av-test.org/)
    * [AV-Comparatives](https://www.av-comparatives.org/)

They could include it in the next test. And pressure the AV companies to act.
AFAIK this has never been done before and I do not know it it will work. But as we live in desperate times...I hate peer pressure. But it gets the job done
