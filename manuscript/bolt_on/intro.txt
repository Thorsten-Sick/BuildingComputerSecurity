# Intro {#chapter-bolt-on-intro}

There is a rift between security engineer. Those who can plan and build a system despise what they call "snalá¸±e oil". It adds complexity (which is bad)
and has no perfect guarantee for security
(protection is statistics with a detection rate of 99.89%).

Some security engineers are not so fortunate and have to deal with a system that is flawed and buggy and they can not change. For technical or political reasons (manager want to use an outdated internal web based tool that is not supported
anymore and only works with and IE from last century). Their only hope is *bolt-on* security tools to manage a deprecated system which is already
way to complex.

This chapter deals with the bolt-on side - which commonly uses detection of attacks.

As security can be a stressfull job, this intro closes with "Be excellent to each other"
