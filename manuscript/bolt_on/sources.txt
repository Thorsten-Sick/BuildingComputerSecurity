## Sources for IOCs

There are many resources online for malware, malicious URLs, other IOCs.
Some of them have a verification system - which results in good quality
with low FPs.

Some are real-time. Some others only contain old software.

Depending on what you use it for they can be the solution or just cause trouble.

Move slowly. Test and verify before enabling the source and over-block.
