Artificial Intelligence became a hot topic in malware protection.
It is the main selling point of "Next Generation" AV. But to some extend it is
part of classical AV for more than 10 years now - I wrote some. I know.
They are just not as good at selling it.

Before we all jump onto the hype train together, let's be honest about
requirements, strengths and weaknesses of AV with AI.

## Requirements

%% TODO: Write it
* Data set
    * > 10 000 samples (malicious and clean)
    * Properly sorted
    * Several samples of each family
* Feature extractor: thousands of features if possible
    * Unpacker
    * Extracting generic features
    * Extracting runtime behaviour (emulation or sandbox)



## Strengths

%% TODO: Write it

* Very good with common malware

## Weaknesses

%% TODO: Write it

* Not good with infected software (large parts of the software are a normal program)
* Not good with targeted attacks
* Not good with drastical changes in malware
* Expect to re-train daily or weekly (depending on your tactics)
