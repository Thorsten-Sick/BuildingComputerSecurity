## Background

### Know your enemies

Describes the types of adversaries your project can face. And their high-level
goals, resources, technologies and tactics. You should [know your enemies](#chapter-attackers)

### Attacker's goals

An in depth list of goals and sub-goals the attackers have - things you will
want to prevent happening. Block the [attack](#chapter-attackers-goals),
protect your system.

### Principles

High level [principles](#chapter-principles) you can use to design a secure system. These principles
are abstract - and you will be able to combine several of them in designing
your project.

## Planning

### Software Design

[Software design](#chapter-design) - also known as architecture - is the bigger picture of the
technological part of the project.
A good design can speed up development, simplify testing, and increase security.
This chapter covers the security basics of software design. Followed by specific
topics in other chapters.

### UX

How to create a [user interface in a secure way](#chapter-user-interface) - preventing the user from
becoming the weakest link.

### Updates

As soon as a software reaches a certain complexity you need updates to ship
patches. This chapter guides you through the challenge of [shipping updates in
a secure way](#chapter-updates).

### Passwords

Passwords are the main way the user authenticates himself. Handling that in a
secure fashion can turn out to be quite complex - but at the same time [there
is enough experience around](#chapter-passwords).

### Browser

The browser is the main software running on most computers. And the interface
for a lot of other technologies. As browsers are complex they are vulnerable.
Some things can be done to [improve browser security](#chapter-browser-security)
- or the security of connected web admin platforms (router config page).

### IoT

Things are getting more smart. Embedded Micro-controllers are cheap. Security
is very often not existing. [This chapter](#chapter-iot) helps to improve that.

### CAN

The CAN bus connects micro-controllers in many embedded systems - especially in
vehicles. Securing it is a challenge - as it was not designed for security.
This chapter will [give you some tools](#chapter-can-bus) - and basics for fuzzing CAN.

### Bluetooth LE

Low Energy Bluetooth can be integrated in many systems. Security is hard
to implement. But possible. [This chapter](#chapter-btle) will give you the tools and basics to
improve security.

### TLS

[TLS is a basic technology to secure data in transit](#chapter-tls). Some may know it as SSL
or HTTPS. And many projects use it.

### Crypto algorithms

Which algorithm to use ? In which mode ? Best key length ? This book is basic,
so this chapter will be more of a [cheat sheet for those essential things](#chapter-crypto-algorithms).
For the curious people: there are resources to dig much deeper.

## Programming

### Code analysis tools table

There are several tools that will assist you during the coding process. This
[table](#chapter-code-analysis-tools-table) will help you to pick the proper ones.

### Defensive programming

Some coding techniques will harden your code against attackers. Positive side
effects like making your code simpler to debug and more robust and stable are
take always that balance the extra effort invested. If you do not yet practice
[defensive programming](#chapter-defensive-programming) you should consider starting it.

### Assert

A very powerful tool for debugging and preventing bugs are *asserts*. They are
even more powerful when combined with *fuzzing*.
When coding, you should start using [asserts](#chapter-asserts) right now.

### Compiling

Modern compilers have lots of less known features to find vulnerabilities
during compile or run time. Or even mitigate - making vulnerabilities harder
to abuse by the attacker. Covered in [this chapter](#chapter-compiling).

### Clang LLVM

Clang is a compiler in the GCC league. It adds some more features for static
and dynamic testing of your code. Those features are cool enough that you
should consider compiling at least the test version using [Clang and those
settings](#chapter-clang).

## Testing

### Testing compiled binaries

To verify that the compiler properly hardened your executable the way you
wanted you (or your testers) will want to use some tools. [This is described here](#chapter-testing-compiling).

### Flawfinder

In addition to your compiler the tool [Flawfinder](#chapter-flawfinder) gets you more verification of
your code. With zero effort.

### CPPCheck

[CPPCheck](#chapter-cppcheck) is Flawfinder enhanced. With the small drawback that you will have to
invest some time in configuration. This chapter will help you there.

### Testing
Is it still testing or already hacking our own product ?
There are many tricks to make software testing more aggressive and which will
shine some light on vulnerabilities in [this chapter](#chapter-testing).


### Fuzzing

[Fuzzing](#chapter-fuzzing) is a technology to find unexpected bugs - most of them potential
vulnerabilities. Pre-existing tools and DIY scripts can do the fuzzing for you.
How to get started is described here.

## Bolt-on security

Bolt-on security is what is done of someone missed to do security-by-design.
Especially myths make it hard to find the right way to use it. These chapters
will bust some myths.

### Antivirus tests

How to properly read antivirus tests. As antivirus is neither a silver bullet
nor useless a [proper estimation](#chapter-antivirus-tests) of it's power
should be done first.

### Antivirus integration

Antivirus can only scan files it gets access to. Many projects could benefit
from an [interface between the project and an already installed antivirus](#chapter-antivirus-integration). And
Microsoft is offering one.

### Antivirus sharing samples

There are several reasons to contact an antivirus vendor

* They have a False Positive on your software
* You found undetected malware (files or URLs)

[This chapter will help you getting started](#chapter-sharing-samples) and give you some internals - the
people working in an antivirus lab are on your side and will love to cooperate.

### Antivirus: VirusTotal

VirusTotal is the go-to way of quick scanning potential malware and
false positives. But has an own tricky personality. Knowing that will [prevent
you from coming to the wrong conclusions](#chapter-virustotal).


## Antivirus: Behaviour based classification

Unknown samples must be classified before detection can be created. A quite
reliable way to achieve that is behaviour based classification. Especially it
is quite simple to interpret the resulting log for malicious behaviour. [The
basics are covered in this chapter](#chapter-antivirus-behaviour-based-classification)
