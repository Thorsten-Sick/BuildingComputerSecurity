## Book: Practical Internet of Things Security {#reference-book-practical-iot-security}

Practical Internet of Things Security by Drew Van Duren, Brian Russell

A very methodic book covering

* Threat modelling
* Design
* Lifecycle
* Basic Cryptography
* Authentication/Authorization
* Complicance monitoring
* IoT Incidence Response

A good overview.

Potential improvement: Go deeper into details and specific technology.
For example: Crypto chapter is a good start but really using crypto will
require more books to be read. Says the one writing a
"security overview book"...I know....
