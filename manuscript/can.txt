# CAN Bus

C> Thorsten Sick

The CAN bus is central in many vehicles and other more complex embedded things.
It connects different microcontrollers and systems in the vehicle. CAN is
simple and cheap - but not the most simple and not the cheapest connection in a system.

It is designed to be reliable - safety - but not for security.

CAN messages do have a message identifier and a payload. There is no *sender*
or *receiver* in the CAN philosophy.

The message identifiers do identify **what** is sent. And every chip listens and
reacts to the messages relevant to it.

On the physical layer: Lower message ids beat higher ones if a collission happens.

There are adapters to connect a PC to a CAN bus (PEAK, for example).

Linux is very well equipped to handle CAN - on current Linux variants you will
see it as a network interface like "can0".

## can-utils

On linux the can-utils offer the basic command line bash interaction functionality.
As stated before, a can bus is just another network interface for Linux.

{lang="bash"}
sudo apt-get install can-utils
sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
candump can0 -L

Now you should see a list of can messages scrolling through.

### candump

### cangen

### cansniffer

### canplayer

### cansend

## wireshark

### Raspberry Pi specific

While the PC Kali OS has drivers for the PEAK can controllers pre-installed,
they are missing for the Raspberry Pi (Kali and Raspbian have been tested).

But the company offered the source code and it is simple to compile them yourself.

You can find the driver source here: https://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/index.htm

{lang="bash"}
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) libpopt-dev
wget https://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/files/peak-linux-driver-8.6.0.tar.gz
tar xvzf peak-linux-driver-8.6.0.tar.gz
cd peak-linux-driver-8.6.0
make PCI=NO PCIEC=NO PCC=NO DNG=NO PAR=NO ISA=NO NET=NETDEV_SUPPORT
sudo make install
sudo modprobe pcan
# check pcan devices
cat /proc/pcan
ifconfig -a

## Python

There is a python api to interact with can. For complex automation and tests I
would prefer that to the command line interface.

Automation includes stress testing and fuzzing.

https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.0/

{lang="bash"}
apt install python3-can

or use *pip* to install it

### The Car Hacker's Handbook: A Guide for the Penetration Tester

A very good book covering hacking of cars. With a big focus on CAN bus hacking.
There is a free version for it available on *opengarages.org* but this page
can currently not be reached. I wish you luck.
