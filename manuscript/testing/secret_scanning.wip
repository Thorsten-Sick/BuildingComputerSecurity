### Do not commit credentials and secrets

Credentials carry permissions and privileges. Like "signing a file" and "access to a server". You do not want those in a Git repository. Even if it is a private one. Sooner or later you will invite other people to contribute. And then those credentials are either forgotten and there as-files or in the git history.

To prevent committing credentials there are special scanners. They look for file names or patterns in the source code that look like a private ssh key or something similar.

For example: [Repo security scanner](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/repo-security-scanner) scans for

* Different private keys
* Different command histories
* Configuration files
* Password files
* PCAPs and other dumps

It is using:

* Filename
* Path
* File extension

to identify critical content.

## Tools for your source code

### DumpsterDiver

It uses creative entropy based password detection. For larger code bases normal mixed case variables with numbers can still trigger this detection and cause False Positives. This is ok if you invest the time to review them. A fallback to regex search is possible.

It is more attacker focused.

### truffleHog

It can be used to scan Github repos. But also source code and can be used as a Github Action (good for your CI/CD). It will verify found credentials using the service APIs. So expect a low FP quote.
Credentials are found using Go plugins searching for regexes. This is specific but maybe hard to get generic for yur own situation.
