# Authors {#chapter-authors}

My goal is to write an anthology.
Contributions from experts in their fields are welcome. Everyone contributing a
chapter gets half a page of biography.

I just do not want to start asking for contributions now. Not until the book
has a well tested and established structure. I would hate to force external
authors to re-write their chapter several times just because the structus is
still developing....

# Credits

Credits are for all the contributors.
