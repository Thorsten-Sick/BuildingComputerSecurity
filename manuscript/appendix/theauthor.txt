# The author {#chapter-the-author}

I have to tell you my origin story. Because you should know where we are going
if you join me by reading this book. I hope it is not boring as no radioactive
spiders are involved....

Trouble shooter and one-man-team somehow happened to be my role quite often.
I am a software developer and engineer who also took the role of
architect/project manager in many security related projects. Which gave me a
good and wide perspective on things in the IT world.

After studying Computer Science (Dipl. Ing FH at University Ravensburg
Weingarten, a German title) I went to Avira. An Anti-Virus/Endpoint
bolt-on-security company.
I handled several projects in teams or connected to teams. More focused on the
architect role or the developer role. Amongst the things I did is:

* An AI SPAM filter in C: String processing in C....
* A full Anti-Virus engine. Cross-compilable. For WinCE, Linux, PalmOS and Symbian. C
* A generic module to detect malware in homepages. Building a kind of DOM. String processing. In C.
* Management security consulting
* Browser extension development - self learning phishing detection. JavaScript
* A government founded research project:
    * Split an OS into several virtual machines for segmentation
    * Scan into these virtual machines without installing anything (Volatility)
    * Classify malware based on behaviour ([Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/))
* Create the architecture of a security/privacy focused Chromium based browser
* Went to the Embedded and IoT world

Right in the middle of doing all those things I started to sort my knowledge
and experience. Resulting in this book.

%% TODO: Add links to the achievements above

These are the bricks of experience and knowledge this book is built out of.

## The origin story: External brain

This book was already written once. As my external brain. Just for me.
I collect my knowledge in "external brains". My own wikis or similar.
My security knowledge external-brain just grew to a stage where I thought
"well, you just wrote a book". And after finding *leanpub* which fits my
style of tackling projects I decided I could transfer my external
brain (written for me) into a book (written for tech people world wide).

And this is currently happening.
