# The author {#chapter-the-author}

I have to tell you my origin story. Because you should know where we are going
if you join me by reading this book. I hope it is not boring as no radioactive
spiders are involved....

Trouble shooter and one-man-team somehow happened to be my role. This and team expert for security.
I am a software developer and engineer who also took the role of architect/project manager in security related projects. Which gave me a good and wide perspective on things in the IT world.

After studying Computer Science (Dipl. Ing FH at University Ravensburg Weingarten, a German title) I went to Avira. An Anti-Virus/Endpoint bolt-on-security company. I handled core detection projects as part of teams. I was focused on the engineering/architect and developer roles. Amongst the things I did is:

* An AI SPAM filter in C: String processing in C....
* A full Anti-Virus engine. Cross-compilable. For WinCE, Linux, PalmOS and Symbian. C
* A generic module to detect malware in homepages. Building a kind of DOM. String processing. In C.
* Management security consulting
* Browser extension development - self learning phishing detection. JavaScript
* A government founded research project:
    * Split an OS into several virtual machines for segmentation
    * Scan into these virtual machines without installing anything (Volatility)
    * Classify malware based on behaviour ([Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/))
* Create the architecture of a security/privacy focused Chromium based browser
* Went to the Embedded and IoT world at Feo, another company
* Mvoing to Avast I wrote a simulation environment to experiment with advanced attacks named [PurpleDome](https://github.com/avast/PurpleDome)


Right in the middle of doing all those things I started to sort my knowledge
and experience. Resulting in this book.

Currently I am Lead Security expert at Primion where I can use all my knowledge.

## The origin story: External brain

This book was already written once. As my external brain. Just for me.
I collect my knowledge in "external brains" a private wiki.
My security knowledge external-brain just grew to a stage where I thought "well, you just wrote a book". And after finding *leanpub* which fits my style of tackling projects I decided I can transfer my external brain (written for me) into a book (written for tech people world wide).

And this is currently happening.
