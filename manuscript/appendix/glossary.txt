# Glossary {#chapter-glossary}

**Adware**: Malware that shows Ads. As the Ad ecosystem generates money for viewed Ads this is how attackers convert infections to money

**APT**: Advanced Persistent Threat. Advanced malware. Quite often by governments. Or just very advanced malware.

**BLE**: Bluetooth Low Energy

**BLE Characteristic**: Value + Descriptor

**BLE GAP**: Advertisements, connection handling, defining device roles in communication

**BLE GATT**: Organizes the data offered by the device

**BLE L2CAP**: Encapsulating data into packets

**BLE Service**: Several Characteristics combined create a service. A default service for BTLE would contain device information

**BLE Profile**: Profiles combine several services. They standardize specific device classes

**Botnet**: Infected machines centrally controlled by the attacker using a C&C

**Bug**: Error made in the programming phase. Not all bugs are vulnerabilities

**C&C**: Command and Control server. Central control over a botnet

**Class break**: A Class break is a vulnerability that breaks the whole device class. Instead of just one single device. Example: Same master key on all devices leaks

**DOS**: Denial Of Service - Attack that exhausts resources of the target (CPU, memory, network, storage)

**DDOS**: Distributes DOS - Attack is done by many systems in parallel

**ELF**: Linux executable file format

**Exploit**: Attack on a vulnerability

**Exploit Kit**: A ready to run malware spreading tool. Normally uses infected web pages to spread the exploit.

**Fast Flux**: Using Round-Robin DNS to hide a C&C server. One URL gets multiple IPs that way.

**Flaw**: Error made in the design phase. Not all flaws are vulnerabilities

**FP**: False Positive. A harmless URL or file is detected as malicious

**Dark Web**: Intentionally hidden parts of the web. Most common TOR pages

%% Deep Packet Inspection:

**Deep Web**: Parts of the web, that is not indexed by search engines (intranets, everything behind a login, ....)

**Domain Flux**: Way to hide C&C servers. A domain name generator creates changing domain names

**DNG / Domain Name Generator**: Part of a malicious script generating possible URLs for C&C servers by time. By registering some of them the attacker can reduce take downs and still get connecting bots.

%% EFF:

**RBN / Russian Business Network**: Rogue ISP offering bullet proof hosting (take downs by police not easy)

**Round-Robin DNS**: Old system for load balancing that does not work with modern clients or IPv6. TTL is short lived.

**IOC**: Indicator of Compromise. A file-hash, URL, registry key or similar feature left by the malware when a system is infected.

**Malware**: Malicious software

**MISRA C**: Guidelines for safe C programming. Tools (compiler and static code analyser) support it. Some of the safety issues are also security issues. Check it out. Low hanging fruit.

**MITM**: Man/Monster in the Middle. Network connections are broken up in the middle by the attacker to spy or modify network packets

%% Static Code analysis

**PE**: Portable Executable file. On Windows .exe and .dll (and some others). Starts wit a DOS Header (MZ)

%% TODO: Phishing and Spear Phishing, Waterhole attacks

**TOR**: The Onion Router. Overlay network over the internet to ensure anonymity of clients and servers

%% CSRF

%% XSS

**Vulnerability**: A bug or a flaw that has security implications

**Weaponizing**: Making an exploit easy and reliable to use.
