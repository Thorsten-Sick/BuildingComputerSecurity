## Goals

Your next project will be **more secure** than your last project.
And this will be almost hassle-free. This is the mission of this book.

This is why I wrote it.

[As an experienced engineer, software developer and security guy](#chapter-the-author) I want
to help you getting started with security features in your projects.

My observation is that there are many specific books for security topics. But
almost no "getting started" books.

This is the itch this book wants to scratch.

## Release early, release often

One of the reasons I dare to write a book is leanpub's feature to release
*early* and *often*. That way I can see progress and get feedback.

Please visit the [forum](https://community.leanpub.com/c/buildingcompute) and
help me improve the book. Or contact me:

* On Twitter: @ThorstenSick
* On Mastodon: @thorsi@chaos.social

As I have been spending lots of time with security focused engineers, the most
important things I want to learn first from you:

* What causes trouble ?
* What kind of technology is currently introduced in normal engineering ?
    * Where does it cause issues ?
* What kind of normal technology (cloud, micro services, IoT) are you using ?

Boiling down to: What do you need from this book ?

## 80/20 or Pareto Principle

Following the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
I will focus on finding the *important* 80 percent of security tips first and
later filling in the missing 20 percent.

This will result in:

* I start a new topic before I squished the last drop out of an older topic
* Instead of spending hours to fine tune the language and optics of an existing chapter I start a new chapter with dozens of new tips

This does not mean I will not do that sooner or later. But I want to get the low hanging fruit first.
I also feel like you expect a book containing lots of good tricks instead of poetry.

## Form follows function

With every iteration of the book I will tune the optics, improve the layout and
maybe add images.

But adding new chapters is more important.

## All this said...

Adding security features to a project can be fun and quite rewarding.
Cherry-pick ideas from this book and get started.
