# The author

Trouble shooter and one-man-team somehow happend to be my role quite often.
I am a software developer and engineer who also took the role of architect/project manager in many
security related projects. Which gave me a good and wide perspective on things
in the IT world.

I have to tell you my origin story. Because you should know where we are going
if you join me by reading this book. I hope it is not boring as no radioactive
spiders are involved....

After studying Computer Science (Dipl. Ing FH at University Ravensburg
Weingarten, a German title) I went to Avira. An Anti-Virus/Endpoint
bolt-on-security company.
I handled several projects in teams or connected to teams. More focussed on the
architect role or the developer role. Amongst the things I did is:

* An AI SPAM filter in C: String processing in C....
* A full Anti-Virus engine. Cross-compilable. For WinCE, Linux, PalmOS and Symbian. C
* A generic module to detect malware in homepages. Building a kind of DOM. String processing. In C.
* Management security consulting
* Browser extension development - self learning phising detection. Javascript
* A government founded research project:
    * Split an OS into several virtual machines for segmentation
    * Scan into these virtual machines without installing anything (Volatility)
    * Classify malware based on behaviour ([Cuckoo Sandbox](#reference-cuckoo-sandbox))
* Create the architecture of a security/privacy focussed Chromium based browser

Now I am moving towards the embedded and IoT world with my new job.

And doing so I started to sort my knowledge and experience. Resulting in this book.
