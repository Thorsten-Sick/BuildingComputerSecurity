"""
If you write network or host detection logic as part of your job, I want you to think about your adversary’s costs in time and money. Detecting metadata, URL path names, User-Agent strings - fine, but all disposable. Instead, detect the encoded field that contains the beacon.
Every time you force your adversary to refactor comms - especially if it requires code changes on their server side - you slow them down and burn them out. If their motivation is financial/opportunistic, they will move on to softer targets.
The same is true for host detection of mission payloads. Write detection for the persistence mechanisms they use or the set of functions they import, especially if they use third party libraries for encryption or communication, because that burns another set of code on their end.
Your objective is to force them into heavy obfuscation (which can also be detected) or to change tools and tactics in order to re-establish a foothold in your environment. Only mission-based actors will persist past this a second or third time, because it’s literally their job.
Long story short, there is asymmetry in defense. Analysis and detection is cheaper than development and testing. Your job is to use that asymmetry to your advantage.
