# Structure of this book {#chapter-structure}

This book is meant to be read twice. First by cherry picking interesting
topics. A second time as toolbox when implementing a feature.

For this reason the book is split. The first few chapters offer an introduction
to the security landscape. The second part contains chapters helping to
solve specific problems.

Chapters contain:

1. Short abstract of the topic
2. Audience
3. TODO list (low hanging fruit)
4. Not-todo list (typical mistakes)
5. In detailed description of the technology
6. Details on how this technology can be attacked
7. Detailed Todo list and Not-todo list
8. References to similar chapters
9. References to external sources like books
10. Authors of this chapter

I will try to stick by this structure. But the main goal is a usable toolbox -
if necessary I will break the rules.

## Project phases and audience

A project has different phases. Depending on your institution different
people could be responsible for each phase. Everyone can contribute to security.
And security will break at the weakest link.

If possible I will put the responsible job description into the *Audience*
block at the beginning of each chapter.
But as the boundaries in your company between the responsibilities can be
different: it is a suggestion. Stages in development are:

* Management
* Architecture/Design/Project Management
* Development
* Testing
* Support
* Analysis (analysis of attacks)
