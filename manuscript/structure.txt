# Structure of this book {#chapter-structure}

This book is meant to be read twice. First by cherry picking interesting
topics and a second time as toolbox when implementing a feature.

For this reason the book is split. The first few chapters offer an introduction
to the security landscape. The second part contains chapters helping to
solve specific problems.

Do not feel bad if you directly skip to something interesting. Or to a chapter
that is currently relevant for your project.

## Project phases and audience

A project has different phases. Depending on your institution different
people could be responsible for each phase. Everyone can contribute to security.
And security will break at the weakest link.

%% Add Software engineering stages. Also to the chapters
%% Management, Requirement gathering, High-level design, low-level design, development, testing, deployment, metrics, maintenance
%% Connect to reference "Beginning Software Engineering"

If possible I will put the responsible job description into the *Audience*
block at the beginning of each chapter.
But as the boundaries in your company between the responsibilities can be
different: it is a suggestion. Stages in development are:

* Management
* Architecture/Design/Project Management
* Development
* Testing
* Support
* Analysis (analysis of attacks)
