# Intro {#chapter-tools-intro}

Using tools is one of the things that is typical for the human species [^wrong].
Tools make us doe more things. In a more reliable way. Have "old" stuff automated away and open us to do new things. They reduce human error.

Many tools did not fit in other chapters. But they are part of our daily work with computers. And they contribute to the daily workflow of building software.

 Those tools are covered in this part of the book.

[^wrong:] This is wrong. Even birds can do remarkable things and even build their own tools...just follow the biological and cognitive science there. This does not invalidate my point. Be smarter than the chicken wings on your plate.
