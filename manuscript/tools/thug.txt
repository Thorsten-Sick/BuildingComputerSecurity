## Basics

[Thug](https://github.com/buffer/thug) is a active low-interactive honey client to check web pages for exploits.

You can find it's [Documentation online](https://thug-honeyclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Thug uses lots of complicated 3rd party libraries. Some not properly maintained.
PyV8. I am looking at you.
PyV8 is a way to connect the V8 JavaScript engine to Python. PyV8 is not
properly maintained at the moment, while all the other libraries change a lot.
If you use a modern Linux as base, it will be tricky to compile.

The docker container fixes these dependency issues for now. It is based on
an old Linux.

Important: It depends on PyV8, which is a python wrapper around the V8 engine.
It will compile properly on Ubuntu 16.04. But fails with a linker error
(-lv8_snapshot not found) on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and newer. The docker image is
based on Ubuntu 16.04.

Build it in the docker directory:

{lang="bash"}
    docker build --tag=thug .

Or download the container:

{lang="bash"}
    docker pull buffer/thug

The run the container:

{lang="bash"}
    docker run --rm -it thug bash

* *rm* remove the container afterwards
* *i* interactive
* *t* allocate a pseudo tty

%% TODO: Do we need "user root" as parameters ?

Now you are in the container and can run thug.

Basic Thug commands:

* -l for local analysis
* -u <personality> switch browser personality
* -A <Acrobat PDF reader version> simulates a vulnerable reader
* -S <Shockwave Flash version> Simulate Shockwave Flash
