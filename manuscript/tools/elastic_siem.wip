# Elastic Search SIEM

https://www.elastic.co/siem

Based on the so called ELK stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana).

## Logstash

Logstash collects data from one source (db, logs, beats, ...) converts it through filters and outputs it to
some other source (Elastic DB, other DB, json files, stdout, ...).

It can run directly on the monitored host or on a special cluster to pre-process log data.
