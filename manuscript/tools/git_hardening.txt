# GIT hardening {#chapter-git}

Git allows to write *hooks* on certain events.

Hooks are simple scripts in a special folder that are executed when this event occurs.

These can be *pre-commit*, *post-checkout* or similar.

In addition to the differentiation by event that triggers it there are two style of hooks:

**Local hooks** are client side and the developer maintains them to simplify their workflow.

**Server-side hooks** are run on the server. They can be run right before the push happens - and this way **enforce** a policy.

When setting up a team process it is smart to search the web for "git-hooks" and use it wisely to improve everyone's workflow (local hooks) and centrally
enforce policy (server-side hooks).

This way especially security relevant things can be cared for ("does it compile without warnings ?" would be the simplest one).

Other ideas would be:

* Coding style
* Good (long) commit messages with links to issues
* Code changes only if unit tests are added as well

This has big benefits on:

* code quality
* enforces best practice even in dire situations
    * gives the developers an explanation towards management ("This will take one more hour, gotta do this right or it will not be checked in")
* lift team spirit, because **THE MACHINE** enforces the coding style, not the other developer who is a grumpy guy and does not allow anything creative

Other problems this will prevent are VCS specific issues like "Do no commit credentials and secrets"

## Do not commit credentials and secrets

Credentials carry permissions and privileges. Like "signing a file" and "access to a server". You do not want those in a Git repository. Even if it is a private one. Sooner or later you will invite other people to contribute. And then those credentials are either forgotten and there as-files or in the git history.

To prevent committing credentials there are special scanners. They look for file names or patterns in the source code that look like a private ssh key or something similar.

[Repo security scanner](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/repo-security-scanner) scans for

* Different private keys
* Different command histories
* Configuration files
* Password files
* PCAPs and other dumps

It is using:

* Filename
* Path
* File extension

to identify critical content.
