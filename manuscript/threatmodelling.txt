# Threat Modelling {#chapter-threat-modelling}

Threat modeling is a way to get an honest overview of the security state of a project.
It should be done quite early (design phase) and continued during the
project - especially when requirements change..

There are several methods for threat modelling.

The big goal of all of then is to achieve better knowledge of all the bad
things that could happen.

To achieve the big goal there are lots of sub-goals you could want to achieve.
The priority of those depends on circumstances like the company goals,
the project state, ...

* System overview
* Systematic check for attack vectors
* Prioritizing of threats
* Guiding non-security people through the process
* Understanding attackers
* Security awareness training
* Documents the security state (and there are software tools for that !)
* Probabilities of the attack to happen

Probabilities of the attack to happen is a bit tricky. As compared to
safety analysis.

A> Ransomware was a factor for the rising bitcoin price. And the rising bitcoin
A> price dragged other crypto currencies up as well. A company created a simple
A> API to mine Monero crypto coins in a web page - as replacement for Ads. And
A> this got abused by crypto miner malware that emerged after the Ransomware.

A> Who could have predicted this 2-3 years cycle ?

The method you pick depends on your exact sub-goals, the people
participating and your personality. Also on external circumstances like
"available time" and "available meeting space".

There is a cool list of [12 methodologies](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2018/12/threat-modeling-12-available-methods.html).
Please read that and other sources to find your set of methods.

Some of those methods I'll explain here. But:
I'll limit the list to special ones, but not necessarily the best:

* STRIDE
* Attack tree
* Persona non Grata (PnG)
* Security cards
* CVSS

Before I forget: You can combine them

## Security cards

Brainstorming method http://securitycards.cs.washington.edu/index.html

## STRIDE

.. TODO: Add details

## Attack tree

## Persona non Grata

## Security cards

## CVSS

## Thorsten Style

I am more a person who loves to enable others. I observed myself to quite
often get into "coffee-machine chats" where I trigger the evil neurons of
people to make them think about the bad things that could happen to their
projects. A 1:1 brainstorming with technical background lessons in 10
minutes with a relaxed athmosphere.

This will not result in a perfect Threat modelled project. But it raises
awareness and will reduce things in the long term.

I would be happy to be able to brag about intentionally inventing it. But this
"just happened" and I observed this pattern around me.

This is not a replacement for a propperly prepared security assessment.
