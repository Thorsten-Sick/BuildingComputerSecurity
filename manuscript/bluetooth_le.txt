# Bluetooth LE {#chapter-btle}


%% .. State: 40 % BluetoothLE

## Basics


Built for short and small data bursts. Info packages sent to well defined Services and Characteristics.

Getting started: [Adafruit BLE](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/introduction)

### Encryption


Security Keys:

All keys are asymmetrical

* TK Temporary Key: Input to derivation of STK
* STK (Short Term Key): Used for key material distribution. Based on TK and random values
* Long Term Key aka LTK: 128 bit encryption key shared
    * Also: Master Identification (EDIV + Rand) as identifier for this connection
* IRK aka Identity Resolving Key: For privacy, hides addresses
    * Identity Address Information: Address Type + Bluetooth Device Address
* CSRK aka Connection Signature Resolving Key: Digitally sign unencrypted data at ATT layer

It is possible to go without encryption. Key exchange happens during the bonding procedure.

BlueZ is the kernel part (and user space tools) for Bluetooth. Bluepy sits on top of BlueZ

## Potential attacks

List of potential attacks for threat modelling:

* Jamming (smart by blocking channels or sending crafted packets, stupid by noise)
* Inpersonating (cloning) of a device
* Passive sniffing (if there is no link layer encryption)
* For encrypted layer: Sniff with ubertooth, sniff the pairing, use crackle to crack it
* DOS a device
* Footprinting (stalking)
* MITM attacks (BTLE)
* Social engineer users into pairing
* MITM by cloning device. If encryption was established before, the connection will not work. The user will very liekly delete/re-pair and end up paired with the attacking device
* to break pairing: Clone device (with MAC). Now the (encrypted) connection will not work anymore. Wait for user to re-pair and sniff that. Crackle to finish

## (Attack) Tools

### Nordic Semiconductor: nRF Connect

Bluetooth LE tool for Android

### Adafruit Bluetooth LE sniffer


Adafruit Bluefruit LE Sniffer - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE 4.0) - nRF51822 - v3.0
[Adafruit BLE sniffer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2269)

[Adafruit BLE sniffer documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-bluefruit-le-sniffer)

Call it with::

{lang="bash"}
  python sniffer.py  /dev/ttyUSB0

After selecting a device it will log the BTLE messages for this device
connection into a pcap file.

To view it properly with wireshark, define the DLT_USER id to be "btle":
Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER, set ID as "btle"

%% .. TODO: Research: Monitor connection when sending commands.

%% Wireshark does not recognize DLT_USER
%% [Ubertooth DLT fix](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/issues/61)
%% go to Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER and enter "btle" as protocol
that should help

### MITM on BTLE

%% .. TODO: Test


### Crack BTLE keys

Crackle brute force temp key
[Crackle](https://lacklustre.net/projects/crackle/)
[Crackle on Github](https://github.com/mikeryan/crackle/)

Input file must contain the complete pairing conversation.

Getting the LTK key::

{lang="bash"}
   crackle -v -i logs/c2.pcap

Decrypting the pcap::

{lang="bash"}
     crackle -v -i logs/encrypted.pcap -o logs/decrypted.pcap

### Basic OS tools


%% .. TODO: BAsic tools as well

{lang="bash"}
    hciconfig hci0 up

scan for le devices:

{lang="bash"}
    hcitool lescan

create a le connection:

{lang="bash"}
    hcitool lecc <address>

delete a le connection:

{lang="bash"}
    hcitool ledc <handle>

{lang="bash"}
    hcitool leinfo <handle> => get some info like manufacturer



**gatttool** for Bluetooth LE::

{lang="bash"}
    gatttool -i <interface> -b <device address> -I
    > connect

%% TODO: Experiment with it !

to connect to a found device

### Ubertooth Utils

[Ubertooth](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth)

### Bleah

  (BLE smart device hacking)

Enumerate services and characteristics on a specific device

{lang="bash"}
    sudo bleah -i 1 -e -b 30:30:30:aa:aa:aa

* -i interface id. 1 is hci1
* -e enumerate
* -b <MAC> mac address of target 

Set a specific value

{lang="bash"}
    sudo bleah -i 1 -b 30:30:30:aa:aa:aa -n 0x39 -d "100"

* -i interface id. 1 is hci1
* -n handle of characteristics
* -d value to set
* -b <MAC> mac address of target

LogiLink BT USB adapter BT0037 works quite well on Kali - built in BT failed on my Laptop.

### Gattack.io

GATT: The "application" layer. While the lower layers very often do not
do encryption (pre-shared keys would be possible, but default is more likely
"none" or something weak), GATT layer could have some DIY encryption.

For the other BTLE encryption methods:

* Unencrypted: Can be broken
* "Just works": The device talks to the MITM encrypted. The MITM to the central unencrypted....broken.
* "Passkey entry" BTLE specification: “Just Works and Passkey
Entry do not provide any passive eavesdropping protection”
* Sometimes the pairing has to be broken first (also for crackle to work)

Gattacker is a node.js based MITM tool for BTLE.

[Gattack](http://gattack.io/)

[Gattacker on Github](https://github.com/securing/gattacker)
[Presentation](https://github.com/securing/docs/raw/master/slides.pdf)

The Gattacker Whitepaper has  a good overview covering BTLE
technology and the possible attacks:
[Gattacker Whitepaper](https://github.com/securing/docs/raw/master/whitepaper.pdf)

Gattack offers those attacks:

* DOS the broadcasting phase (before pairing)
* Cloning and spoofing a device
* passive interception of unencrypted transmissions
* active interception (MITM)
* module interface - attack open GATT services
* password brute forcing
* GATT value fuzzing

%% .. TODO: Check in tool of those are there

## BtleJack

Is a new attack on BLE

[BtleJack on Github](https://github.com/virtualabs/btlejack)

* Sniffing existing connections
* Sniffing new BLE connections
* Jamming BLE connections
* Hijacking connections
* Can export sniffed packets as PCAP

## Books

There is a [list of books](#reference-collection-btle) and tools.

BTLE is a complex topic and depending on your learning style you should
either start at the *hands-on* side or at the *theoretical* side.

No matter where you start, it is very likely that you will also need some
(cheap) btle tools and products.

## Beacons

## Glossary

GAP: Advertisements, connection handling, defining device roles in communication
GATT: Organizes the data offered by the device
Characteristic: Value + Descriptor
Service: Several Characteristics combined create a service. A default service for BTLE would contain device information
Profile: Profiles combine several services. They standardize specific device classes
L2CAP: Encapsulating data into packets
