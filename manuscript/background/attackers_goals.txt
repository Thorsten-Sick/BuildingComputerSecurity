# Attacker's goals {#chapter-attackers-goals}

Attackers have goals they want to achieve. Many of them are linked to *making money*.
In those cases there are some specific things to be aware of:

* Very often the damage to the victim is larger than the gain of the attacker
* The attacker automates the attacks and aims for high numbers of victims
    * several hundred thousand or millions of victims is possible or even common
    * gain per victim can be in the $1-5 range. But with the big number of victims results for the attacker are still huge
* Attackers can sit in countries with good infrastructure, good computer science education and no well paid it jobs.
    * Even if the money the "earn" by the attack does not sound a lot to you - for them it is
    * According tho their local living standards they will be rich after a modestly successful attack

An attack (let's say *malware*) can have several goals. Malware is modular and
different attack modules can be downloaded by the attacker sitting and the
command console of the malware.

Stolen credentials (passwords, accounts, credit card numbers) are shared as bulk on the black market.
Offers like "1000 unverified credit card numbers for $X" are the result.

Another criminal will pay for those numbers and check if the numbers are valid and working and retrieve the cash.

## Ransomware

Ransomware has a direct and obvious way to generate money for the criminals. Files are taken
hostage by encrypting them forcing the user to pay to get the decryption key.

Protection would be to do **regular backups**.

## Mining

Mining malware generates crypto currencies by running mining tools on the victim's computer. As the energy
and processing power is stolen that way the take away of this can be significant - or minor, if the
criminal did not estimate the cloud processing power his botnet would generate.

Protection is detecting processes sucking up processing power. **Monitor system behaviour for anomalies**

## Credential stealing

A common module for malware is Pony aka Fareit. It extracts passwords from
browser - stealing generic account data and from FTP clients.

The FTP credentials are very often accounts used for maintaining web pages.
Those are valuable to later hack those web pages and add exploits for attacks
on new victims.

%% TODO: Add link to pony description

There is also the component [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz).
It is able to extract the credentials from memory.

Technologies to reduce the impact of those attacks would be:

* Always store data encrypted
* overwrite memory containing those credentials ASAP
* monitor access to those db files
* protect against malware infections

None of these is perfect.
If a computer is infected by a running malware, the game is over.

## Injecting advertising

Advertising is a crazy market with lots of actors. Some of the Ad companies do
not validate the Ads they are circulating to be shown in browsers. That way
they spread malicious ads that infect computers - this practice is named *malvertizing*.

In this grey market malware intercepts web requests to replace them to Ads that
are affiliated to the attacker.

Going for peanuts. But heaps of peanuts.

Protection would be to **block Ads** in the browser, **protect the router**
and **encrypt network connections**.

## Banking

Attackers can either infect you PC or your router (with a malware called
DNSChanger) to intercept and modify your banking transactions.

If you are running any kind of banking or money-oriented web service, your
countermeasures should include:

* **End to end encryption with authentication (TLS)**
* **Two factor authentication** (SMS, special crypto tokens, ...)
    * The last one is not perfect, especially if the mobile phone is used for online banking *and* as the second factor.

## Wiping

There are attacks covering as Ransomware - but without any hope of getting the
data back. Those are called "Wipers". Either the criminals failed and
implementing the crypto part properly or they are not interested in the ransom
but want to invoke mayhem.

One more reason to wipe the system as part of an attack is to hide evidence.
The cover story of a "normal" ransomware attack is convenient.

Protection is **backups**

## Sending SPAM

Still a goal of malware authors is to use the acquired botnet to send out SPAM.
The reasons they need a cluster of hacked computers are:

* They need the bandwidth for millions of Spams
* machines sending SPAM get block listed at central lists. The criminals have to rotate those machines
    * *If your mails end up as SPAM quite often, check if you are block listed somewhere*

Protection is to **monitor (firewall) outbound traffic**

## DDOS for hire

Hacked machines are used to DDOS web servers and services. Those server's
owners are blackmailed to pay the attacker to stop the attacks.
The computers being part of the DDOS botnet are victims and attackers at the
same time.

Protection is to **monitor (firewall) outbound traffic**

## Proxy for further attacks

The hacked computer system can be used as a proxy to hide the attacker
doing further attacks on other systems. If those 3rd parties notice the attack
they can not trace the connection back to the attacker. On a network level it
looks like the attack originated from the proxy.

Those would get block listed or sued.

Protection is **network monitoring**. Also of outbound traffic.

## Persistence

A part of the attack is to achieve persistence. This is: The attack tool even
survives a system reboot or even some kind of cleanup.

This is not necessary for an attack, some just accept that after a reboot they
either lose the infected system from their botnet or hope for a re-infection
through the channels that worked the first time.

For the defender the persistence part is relevant because they can **check at
well known parts of the system** for traces of the malware.

* auto-started programs
* boot record
* registry keys

%% TODO Ask Stefan for typical persistence tricks. Maybe write a chapter.

## A trick: Living off the land

More an attacker's trick is "Living off the land". The attacker infects one
system. And starts using existing tools to create a beachhead or start lateral movement.

To make their life a lot harder (and cause them to risk triggering more alarms),
remove useless files and simplify the systems before the invasion.

Things to weed out:

* System binaries
* Compilers
* Network tools (wget, ftp, nc, nmap, ....)
* libraries (especially network libs like pcap)

## A common requirement: C&C server

Some malware is autonomous. But the more flexible one will be remote
controlled as a *botnet*. To achieve that the attacker has a remote control
software with a nice GUI. From that the attacker can select a list of infected
machines (maybe by country, available bandwidth) and make them do things
(malware updates, DDOS, looking for paydata).
*The good news is*: The network connection to the C&C server could be detected.
Authorities could take the server down, admins can block the connection.
*The bad news is*: Attackers learned how to hide the traffic in other
protocols. And how to run fallback servers to be able to continue their "business".

## Selecting victims

There are two basic attack patterns

### Targeted attacks

Attackers tend to invest lots of time into one specific victim or a group of victims.
Using online research and social engineering techniques the attacker tries to
improve the chances of the attack. Especially by writing a very targeted
and convincing phishing mail and attaching a link to the malware or the
malware itself (doc with macro, PDF).
The attackers know about the system of the victim and build the malware
specifically for the weaknesses of the system.

### Opportunistic attacks

The attackers have a malware and tools to attack systems with a specific
weakness ("everyone running an 5 year old Acrobat reader"). They do a
fire-and forget tactics trying to get as many potential victims into contact
with this attack. The success rate will be very small. But as many potential
victims get attacked in parallel some will be infected.
The attacker will find out later if any valuables got caught in the net.
