# Intro {#chapter-background-intro}

This book is written for the experienced engineer, manager, tester. And not for experienced security experts. So far security knowledge has not been very
accessible. There are films - and most are horribly wrong. And there are complex books covering a specific topic in depth.

If you not hyper-focused on security is is quite easy to either get lost in myths or complexity.

I want to get you the foundations to contribute to the security of your product.

The takeaway of this chapter will be:

* You know *who* could attack your technology
* You know *why*
* You will learn the basic *principles* of protection
* You will also learn about the technology available to the attacker
