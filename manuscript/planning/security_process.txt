## Basics

A company needs internal processes to handle security incidents.
Incidents will happen. And if everyone knows how to handle those emergencies
and had enough fire-drills, handling the indicents will be much smoother than without.

As every company is different (size, structure, goals) it is hard to write a
one-size-fits-all manual. I will still try to collect the essential pieces.
But finding an expert to assist you in this endeavour would be smart.
