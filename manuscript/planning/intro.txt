# Intro {#chapter-planning-intro}

Design flaws are as bad as programming bugs: Both are vulnerabilities an attacker can abuse.

A software or hardware design well done can simplify programming and strongly improve security.

Many specific technologies require domain knowledge to be used in a secure fashion. For example a crypto library offers an API to be used by programmers without having them understand the maths. This API can be simple and fool-proof or built-for-experts with lots of ways to make horrible mistakes. In the last case you will require lots of domain knowledge to build a secure application.

This chapter will extend principles from the background chapter into technology specific knowledge.
